<h6>Cricket</h6>
<p>Cricket is very intersting game where both the teams have 11 players.The batting side scores runs by <b>striking</b> the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this by <b>preventing</b> the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").</p>
